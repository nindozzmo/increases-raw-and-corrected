# increases-raw-and-corrected

Hello! This little app can read measurements, which stores in the 'input.txt' file and find out, how many times each measurement was larger than the previous one.
To get rid of some noise in the data, the app then corrects result with three-measurement sliding window method. On the output you have both results â€” raw and corrected.
